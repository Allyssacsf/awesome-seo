## Algorithm Change History

 - Penguin
  -2016
   - **Jan 8, 2016 - Unnamed Update:** Multiple tracking tools (including MozCast reported historically-large rankings movement, which Google later confirmed as a "core algo update". Google officially said that this was not a Penguin update, but details remain sketchy.
   - **Sep 13, 2016 - Image/Universal Drop:** MozCast recorded a nearly-record 111째 temperature and a 50% drop in SERPs with image (universal/vertical) results. The universal result shake-up opened up an organic position on page 1, causing substantial ranking shifts, but it's likely that this was part of a much larger update.
   - **Sep 23. 2016 - Penguin 4.0 Announcement:** 째 temperature and a 50% drop in SERPs with image (universal/vertical) results. The universal result shake-up opened up an organic position on page 1, causing substantial ranking shifts, but it's likely that this was part of a much larger update.
   - **Sep 27, 2016 - Penguin 4.0 Phase 1:** The first phase of Penguin 4.0, which probably launched around September 22-23, was the rollout of the new, "gentler" Penguin algorithm, which devalues bad links instead of penalizing sites. The exact timeline is unconfirmed, but we believe this rollout took at least a few days to fully update, and may have corresponded to an algorithm temperature spike (113째) on September 27th.
   - **Oct 6, 2016 - Penguin 4.0 Phase 2:** The second phase of Penguin 4.0 was the reversal of all previous Penguin penalties. This seemed to happen after the new code rolled out, and may have taken as long as two weeks. Post-Penguin activity had one final peak on October 6th (116째), but it is unclear whether this was Penguin or a new update. Algorithm temperatures finally started to drop after October 6th.
  -2014
   - **Oct 17, 2014 - Penguin 3.0:** More than a year after the previous Penguin update (2.1), Google launched a Penguin refresh. This update appreared to be smaller than expected (less than 1% of US/English queries affected) and was probably data-only (not a new Penguin algorithm). The timing of the update was unclear, especially internationally, and Google claimed it was spread out over "weeks".
   - **Dec 20, 2014 - Penguin Everflux:** A Google representative said that Penguin had shifted to continous updates, moving away from infrequent, major updates. While the exact timeline was unclear, this claim seemed to fit ongoing flux after Penguin 3.0 (including unconfirmed claims of a Penguin 3.1).
  -2013
   - **May 21, 2013 - Domain Crowding:** Google released an update to control domain crowding/diversity deep in the SERPs(pages 2+). The timing was unclear, but it seemed to roll out just prior to Penguin 2.0 in the US and possibly the same day internationally.
   - **May 22, 2013 - Penguin 2.0 (#4):** After months of speculation bordering on hype, the 4th Penguin update (dubbed "2.0" by Google) arrived with only moderate impact. The exact nature of the changes were unclear, but some evidence suggested that Penguin 2.0 was more finely targeted to the page level.
   - **Oct 4, 2013 - Penguin 2.1 (#5):** After 4.5 months gap, Google launched another Penguin update. given the 2.1 designation, this was probably a data update(primarily) and not a major change to the Penguin algorithm. The overall impact seemed to be moderate, although some webmasters reported being hit hard. 
   - **Dec 17, 2013 - Unnamed Update:** Almost all global flux trackers registered historically high activity. Google would not confirm an update, suggesting that they avoid updates near the holidays. MozCost also registed a rise in some Partial-Match Domains (PMDs), but the patterns were unclear.
  - 2012
   - **May 4, 2012 - April 52 Pack:** Google published details of 52 updates in April, including changes that were tied to the "Penguin"update. Other highlights included a 15% larger "base" index, improved pagination handling and a number of updates to sitelinks.
   - **May 25, 2012 - Penguin 1.1:** Google rolled out its first targeted data update after the "Penguin" algorithm update. This confirmed that Penguin data was being processed outside of the main search/
   - **Oct 5, 2012 - Penguin #3:** After suggesting the next Penguin update would be major, Google released a minor Penguin data update, impacting "0.3% of queries". Penguin update numbering was rebooted, similar to Panda - this was the 3rd Penguin release.
